== Background

this information is to review basic of physics:

- basic knowledge of physics theory
- mathematics equations

This information will be used to deduce the following end-user information:

- ASK and FSK packets with precise timestamp, possibly with bitrate and demodulation info
	* packets extracted from bits
	* bitrate calculated from precise timestamp
	* ASK amplitude extracted from amplitude samples
	* FSK deviation extracted from frequency samples

== test math format

stem:[sqrt(4) = 2]

stem:[H_2O]

latexmath:[C = \alpha + \beta Y^{\gamma} + \epsilon]

A matrix can be written as stem:[[[a,b\],[c,d\]\]((n),(k))].

== Photoelectric

Kinetic energy is not depend on intensity of light but it’s depend on only frequency of light


|===
|stem:[E = h.f]

|===
- h: Planck constant = *6.62607015e−34 Js* (joule second)
- f: Frequency of light

stem:[V_s = frac{E_{kmax}}{e}]

- Vs: stopping potential (voltage)

_note: So energy could be in eV (electron volt)_

|===
|stem:[E_{kmax} = hf - \phi]

|===
stem:[\phi]: work function or energy needed to liberate an electron
stem:[f_o]: threshold frequency
